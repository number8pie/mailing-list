#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

New files unsubscribe.html and unsubscribe.php to allow users to remove themselves from the mailing list.
Renamed a few files.
Added links to the bottom of pages to navigate, and also to success messages.

Next to do:
1 - To have the success message on the same page, I need the php that's executed on the same page. Next task when putting some polish on this project.
2 - Add a log in to the send email page, maybe rename it admin.
