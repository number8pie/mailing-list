#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added error message variable to index.php, error message is now echoed above the form. Styled.
Added sticky values to the form in index.php.
(Last commit with similar messages was for sendmail.php)
Wrote if loop in index.php that will either show the form and error messages, if there are any error messages, or the success message. Styled.
Added nav to get around the pages easier, put the nav in an include file in a new inc folder. Set a variable at the top of each page so that the nav using an if loop can set the class active to the current page. Styled.

Next to do:
1 - Add a log in to access the send email page. (to be done at a later date, as this is a more advance subject, password encryption, salts etc.)
