#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added some form validation to the script, not completely happy with the methof the book has used; lots if if's.
A bit if'y, hah!
Deleted sendmail.html and instead copied all the html into sendmail.php, and made the form self-referencing.
Useful method of making a form self-referencing is using $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] so if the file is ever renamed it will still reference itself. Use this as the action: <?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>.

Next to do:
1 - Create an error message variable, and use concatenation to add messages to it when a field is empty. Then if there's an error echo the error message variable on the page with the form. 
2 - If the user had entered data into the form, have it remain in the form after the error message is echoed.
3 - Add a log in to the send email page, maybe rename it admin.
