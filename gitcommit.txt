#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added error message variable to index.php, error message is now echoed above the form. Styled a bit.
Added sticky values to the form in index.php.
(Last commit with similar messages was for sendmail.php)
Now what I want is for the form OR the success message to show, I'll create a new branch (success_msg) to get this working.

Next to do:
1 - Make the index and subscribe page self-referencing.
2 - Make the error messages show on the same page above the form like sendmail.php.
3 - Sort out the navigation links.
4 - Add a log in to access the send email page.
