#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Added error message variable, error message is now echoed above the form. Styled a bit.
Added sticky values to the form.

Next to do:
1 - I need to make it so that the error messages are displayed near the form, currently right at the top of the page, I didn't think I needed an error message variable but I think this is the wa to do this.
2 - If the user had entered data into the form, have it remain in the form after the error message is echoed.
3 - Add a log in to access the send email page.
