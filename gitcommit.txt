#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Setting up PHP mailer with WAMP so I can check that the script is working properly, and check that the success messages are displayed like the other pages. Creating a new branch to do this: phpmailer.

Next to do:
1 - Success message on sendmail.php needs to look the same as the error and success messages on other pages.
2 - Prevent sql injection on all input fields in index and sendmail.
3 - Add a log in to access the send email page. (to be done at a later date, as this is a more advance subject, password encryption, salts etc.)
