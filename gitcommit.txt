#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Set up phpmailer with wamp. That was... a grind.
Success messages now look like the other pages, and either they show or the form shows.

Next to do:
1 - Prevent sql injection on all input fields in index and sendmail.
2 - Add a log in to access the send email page. (to be done at a later date, as this is a more advance subject, password encryption, salts etc.)
