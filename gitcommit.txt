#NEXT COMMIT MESSAGE:

Changed the method of checking if a form has been posted, to: $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST". Form submission works now.
Creating a new branch to get the error message displayed right and make the form values the user has entered sticky if it encounters an error.

Next to do:
1 - I need to make it so that the error messages are displayed near the form, currently right at the top of the page, I didn't think I needed an error message variable but I think this is the wa to do this.
2 - If the user had entered data into the form, have it remain in the form after the error message is echoed.
3 - Add a log in to access the send email page.
